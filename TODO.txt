Things we could add
-------------------

- document examples for pseudo-versioning by adding a version-number into URL

- looks like uri_for() magic stops working after some Moose version. find out.

## done 2010-04-13 by Phil Soehnlein. 'Expires' is cool.
- find out clever HTTP Headers to set.

### done.
- add to config section:
    replace => {
                       # for every file -- how to quote '$1' ??? --> s{$regex}{qq{qq{$replace}}}ee
        '*'         => [ 'url\\(images/([^)]+)\\)' => 'url(/static/images/$1)' ],
        
                       # some files only
        'jquery*'   => [ qr'color:\s*#123456' => 'color: #987654' ],
        
                       # just this file
        'jquery-ui' => [ ... => ... ],
    },
