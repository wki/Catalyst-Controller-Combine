Revision history for Catalyst-Controller-Combine

0.15    2012-05-04
        * modified the handling of dir. It is resolved now in order to
          allow ".." containing config settings without firing the security
          violation-error.

0.14    2012-02-20
        * fixed date arithmetic to only use DateTime instead of time()
          neccesary due to a testing failure with a rounding problem

0.13    2011-07-28
        * added an 'include' config directive allowing to recursively include
          other files. Useful for evaluating @import css files.
        * expanded the files generated by Helper
        
0.12    2010-05-21
        * fixed a security hole reported and patched by Andreas Specht (ac0v)
          that allowed to use url-encoded path-parts to crawl along our
          file system and read files outside the intended directory.
          Now, trying to access files outside the wanted directories simply 
          lets the Controller die.
        * added a test to verify this.
        * simplified expire header handling.
          
0.11    2010-04-01
        * fixed a bug that wrongly compared paths during test
          this made one test fail under MS-Windows.
          -- Thanks, CPAN-Testers!

          was hardcoded and wrong for this platform

0.09    2010-03-13
        * added a replace option allowing to change files on the fly

        Tests break
        * Moose 0.85 / Class::MOP 0.88 were known to work
